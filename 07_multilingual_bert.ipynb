        "We're now facing the same problem we discussed in the word embedding notebooks - we may not have enough data to train a good model. This is even more important for deep learning, since neural networks perform best on large amounts of training data and because training the best performing models from scratch require more computing power than we can access. So, as with word embeddings, let's make use of some open source pre-trained models.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may remember that a previous notebook mentioned fine-tuning. This is the process of slightly retraining a model using our own data, instead of just using a pre-trained model for feature extraction. Hopefully this will let us benefit from both the general knowledge of the pre-trained model and the specific nuances of our training data. The most basic type of fine-tuning, which we'll try here, just adds a single layer on top of a model's existing architure for a specific classification task. You might also decide to unfreeze and retrain other layers in the model if you were taking a more complex approach to fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll try to fine-tune the multi-lingual version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained model produced by Google using an architecture they developed ([read more here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/ \n",
        ")). The `transformers` library has become popular as a way to access large pre-trained NLP models, including BERT, so we'll use that. Significant portions of this notebook are based on ([this tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/#11-using-colab-gpu-for-training)), but I've tried to include clearer explanations and modified some of the code. \n",
